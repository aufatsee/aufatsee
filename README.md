- MSBD5001 (L1) - Foundations of Data Analytics
-
- Description: the self-written Python program was prepared in Kaggle website with the Random Forest algorithm to generate
-              the results that was determined by the Kaggle scoring automatically after the submission
-    
- Special Notes: Due to the design of the random forest, the data were randomly picked from the training data set and by splitting
-                randomly, therefore, the produced prediction model may not be 100% identical at each iteration
-
- Output Results: a series of results were uploaded to the Kaggle, and the best scoring was 1.00, while the rest of trials
-                 achieved only 0.93 to 0.96, respectively
-                 
- Source: Please note that the source code "notebook-individual-randomforest.ipynb" was used to generate the submission result
- 
- Execution : Please upload the source code to Kaggle and under the <MSBD5001-Spring 2022> programme
-
- Output: Then run all the source, and will generate the "submission.csv" file as the output
-
- The source data path are using the default files stored at:
- /kaggle/input/msbd5001-spring-2022/train.csv
- /kaggle/input/msbd5001-spring-2022/test.csv
